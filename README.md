# Refactoring-code

The code was only refactored to make it more user-friendly.
The samatic hmtl tags were replaced with pre-existing devvs, so that its easier to users to identify functions and to make the pre-eisting website more accessible.

The ccs was also configured to make it more shorter and managable.
